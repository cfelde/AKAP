# AKAP

The AKA protocol is somewhat like LDAP for Ethereum. It allows you to
reference content and data, and also navigate structures in the context
of nodes and a directed acyclic graph.

This project is at a draft/beta stage and we welcome contributions in
the form of feedback, comments, code review and test cases.

Please have a read of the [white paper](WHITEPAPER.md). While in draft
form pull requests are welcomed on any aspect of the white paper, from
simple spelling or sentence issues to more fundamental discussions on
the approach taken.
